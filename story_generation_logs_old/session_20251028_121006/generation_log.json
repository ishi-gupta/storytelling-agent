She maps bell pulls, speaking tubes, and grille sightlines; the hum registers on her decibel meter.\n- Chapter 3: Kline bristles but produces duplicate supply ledgers with odd overages; Caleb knows the culvert and tide windows; Felix talks \u201cheritage experiences\u201d and flashes a gate key; Rao insists on preserving \u201coriginal systems\u201d; Marla arrives with subwoofers and RF mics.

In the boathouse, she finds yacht line scuffs and a locker sized for audio gear; Felix\u2019s burner pings off a pier tower.\n- Chapter 5: A staged \u201cmanifestation\u201d drives Olivia into a panic attack; Mara kills the effect by pulling power to a sub in a duct\u2014hum drops, her tinnitus eases. She finds a concealed service alcove with a view grille to the east hall and bell-wire runs patched with fresh solder.\n- Chapter 6: the east-wing door latch can be thrown via repurposed bell wire; the gouges match a line dragged around the newel.

Mara stepped off with a single duffel and a hard-shell case, the wet air slicking her hair flat. A foghorn moaned somewhere deep in the white\u2014low, rounded, twice before it swallowed itself. She tapped her phone. Eighteen seconds between calls. Good.\n\nOlivia waited under a sodium lamp, a small bright island in the gloom, blazer clinging dark at the shoulders. \u201cMs. Voss? I\u2019m Olivia Crane.\u201d Her smile held, her eyes measured. \u201cYou made good time.\u201d\n\n\u201cMarine forecast said I had a window.\u201d Mara hoisted the case. \u201cLet\u2019s use it. I\u2019ll need unrestricted access to the east wing, roofline, subfloor. And anything with a lock on it.\u201d\n\nA cough of boots behind Olivia announced Ortega\u2014security jacket zipped to the throat, cap pulled low, hands empty but not relaxed. \u201cThat\u2019s not how we do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s how I do it,\u201d Mara said. The foghorn went again. She thumbed the stopwatch. Seventeen this time. \u201cWe can argue or we can work.\u201d\n\nOlivia angled her body between them, damp blazer squeaking. \u201cWe have liability concerns. Contractors have slipped, broken\u2014 We\u2019re not set up for free range.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour board hired me to fix a problem efficiently. Efficiency requires autonomy, not a parade.\u201d Mara\u2019s tone softened half a step. \u201cI don\u2019t do risks. I do controls.\u201d\n\nOlivia\u2019s gaze flicked to Ortega, then to the lights ribboning the bulk of the building beyond the dock. \u201cConditional full access,\u201d she said at last. \u201cKeycard, system codes. You notify before entering restricted zones. No roof in high wind. No solo ladder work.\u201d\n\n\u201cNotification, yes,\u201d Mara said. \u201cPermission, no.\u201d\n\nOrtega snorted and started walking. \u201cAdmin\u2019s this way. Stay with me.\u201d He didn\u2019t add please.\n\nThey moved off the dock, shoes ticking the grating, fog pebbled with sodium halos. The main doors sighed them into the lobby\u2019s warm dryness. Under the HVAC chill, the building carried a low, even hum\u2014electric, steady, a solid baseline in the bones. Mara held her breath for a beat and counted it against the horn outside, the two rhythms crossing like threads. Baseline: sixty-cycle with a vibrato from the older air handlers. She logged it.\n\nOrtega badge-tapped them through to the admin corridor. Fluorescents ran like a spine. \u201cYou\u2019ll sign for the keycard,\u201d he said. \u201cCameras stay live. You keep your phone on.\u201d\n\nOlivia produced a lanyard and a slim black fob, plus a folded list of numeric codes. \u201cEverything but payroll,\u201d she said. \u201cIf a door denies you, call me. I\u2019ll override. I\u2019m trusting your judgment.\u201d\n\nMara accepted the card, the paper, the weight of what she needed. \u201cI\u2019ll inform. I won\u2019t ask.\u201d\n\nOrtega watched her slide the lanyard over her head. \u201cI walk you through once. After that, you ping me if you want a shadow.\u201d\n\n\u201cSoft escort,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cNot constant.\u201d\n\nThe foghorn reached them even here, a muted pulse through the walls. Eighteen again. Mara wrote it down, along with the hum. \u201cThat works,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Olivia replied, and the three of them set off down the corridor, their footsteps matching the building\u2019s measured purr.",

She logged it without looking.\n\nInside, the corridor was a silvered tunnel of covered furniture and taped doors. Dust bloom drifted in her headlamp. At the first landing window, she found the sash painted shut and still\u2026 newly stubborn. She probed the seam. The blade hit metal. Mara scraped paint with a dental pick until two nail heads showed bright as fish eyes.\n\n\u201cFresh nails through the sash rail. Cut heads, not countersunk. Oxide minimal.

Kline was already at the table, a banker\u2019s smile on, two fat binders and a thinner twin stacked like nested dolls.\n\n\u201cPer your request,\u201d he said, sliding the thinner one toward her. \u201cWorking copy.\u201d\n\nMara flipped it open. The columns mirrored the main ledger\u2014dates, vendors, line codes\u2014until they didn\u2019t. A run of purchases flagged \u201cfacility maintenance\u201d in the official book appeared as \u201caudio support\u201d here, with line items that read like scavenged tech jargon: piezo stacks, impedance-matching transformers, cable by the kilometer.\n\n\u201cYou do two sets?\u201d Mara asked, pen hovering.\n\n\u201cReconciliations,\u201d Kline said. \u201cOne for audit, one with vendor detail. Our donors enjoy privacy. You\u2019ll find totals align.\u201d\n\n\u201cYet the labels change.\u201d She tapped a row. \u201cWhy does a historic trust need twenty-four \u2018acoustic transducers\u2019 and four \u2018amplifier chassis, weatherized\u2019?\u201d\n\nKline\u2019s smile thinned. \u201cWe host events. The gala. Lectures. You saw the hall.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese ship to a P.O. box,\u201d she said, turning the page. \u201cNot the hall.\u201d\n\nHe stiffened. \u201cThat\u2019s a receiving service. Coastal properties complicate delivery. Caleb knows.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know we sign for what we install,\u201d Caleb said from the doorway, maps under his arm. \u201cIf it passed my dock, I\u2019d recall it.\u201d\n\nKline\u2019s gaze went cool. \u201cYou\u2019re free to reconcile, Ms.\u2014Mara. But don\u2019t mistake prudence for subterfuge.\u201d\n\nShe photographed pages, the vendor list, the PO box numbers, then closed the duplicate with care. \u201cI\u2019m noting the differences. That\u2019s all.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s never all with you,\u201d he said, almost softly, then checked his watch. \u201cI have donors by ten.\u201d\n\nThe service-tunnel map room was a white cinderblock cube with a light that hummed in a key her ear didn\u2019t like. Caleb unrolled blue mylar like a card trick.\n\n\u201cFour culvert mouths,\u201d he said, tapping grease-pencil to a coastal profile. \u201cMain sluice at the east seawall\u2014grated, padlocked. Secondary drains under the rose slope\u2014smaller mesh. Overflows tie into the service crawl, here and here. Hearth ash pits share a chase, but they\u2019re dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cClearance?\u201d Mara asked.\n\n\u201cMain culvert can fit a man in spring outflow if he\u2019s stupid. Today the tide\u2019s low; you could crouch. But the grate is bolted from our side. Rusted like hell.\u201d\n\n\u201cBolts loosen,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cPeople drown,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do this with a harness and an extra set of eyes, or not at all.\u201d\n\nShe nodded, already marking a route in her head. \u201cWe\u2019ll need eyes, then.\u201d\n\nThey stepped onto the boathouse deck into salt and gulls. Felix leaned on a piling, sun on his cheekbones, spinning a brass key on a carabiner.\n\n\u201cTour concludes with refreshments?\u201d he said, grin easy. He held the key up. \u201cBecause if you want the executive entrance\u2014ta-da.\u201d\n\nCaleb went flint-hard. \u201cWho issued you that?\u201d\n\n\u201cHouse perks,\u201d Felix said. \u201cI charm. Doors open.\u201d\n\n\u201cProtocol says that stays logged,\u201d Caleb said, hand out.\n\nFelix let the key drop into his palm, then tugged it back, playful. \u201cRelax.

The map lines were clean in her pocket. The deck boards creaked under three sets of shoes that didn\u2019t share a cadence.",

In the adjacent hall, a portable truss was half-built, gaffer tape like stitches across the baseboards.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t step on the orange,\u201d Marla said, kneeling with a fistful of XLR. \u201cThat\u2019s my return to the PA. We\u2019re doing a thirty-second tease at two. Little goosebumps appetizer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need five clean minutes before you flood the spectrum,\u201d Mara said, setting her case on a rolling stool. She popped the latches: tablet, SDR, near-field probe, patch pigtails. \u201cBaseline hum\u2019s at sixty with a fat third harmonic. I want to see what moves when your show hits.\u201d\n\nMarla tilted her chin at the racks. \u201cYou hear a hymn, I hear an audience. Same church.\u201d She flicked on a compact mixer. \u201cWe\u2019re only riding the house feed, plus my wireless. It\u2019ll be gentle.\u201d\n\nIn the hall, a staffer on a ladder aimed a horn speaker at the plaster. \u201cWe\u2019ll pipe the medium from the green room,\u201d Marla called. \u201cShe\u2019s camera-shy until tonight.\u201d\n\nA test tone chirped. Mara clipped the probe to a patch bay faceplate and watched the waterfall bloom. \u201cOkay. Map grid,\u201d she said, and taped off eight chalked letters along the hall\u2019s baseboard. She moved the probe from A to H, logging amplitudes, snapping photos.\n\nOver the PA, a woman\u2019s voice rolled in velvet. \u201cCan you feel it? The room remembering\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHold,\u201d Mara said.\n\nMarla rolled her eyes but lifted a hand to the staffer. The promo hung like perfume.\n\nMara\u2019s screen bled in a new comb at 540.3 MHz, teeth at 200 kHz intervals. Another lobe flared near 2.408 GHz. She nudged the probe toward the conduit that ducked into the east wall. The signal jumped.\n\n\u201cYour wireless pack?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cBlocks 24 through 26,\u201d Marla said, already scrolling her phone. \u201cWe\u2019re on 542.125 for the medium. Legal as pie.\u201d\n\nMara overlaid the trace on her baseline. The sixty-cycle hump pulsed\u2014just perceptible\u2014beating with the PA content. She touched the probe to the HVAC control can. The comb brightened.\n\n\u201cAgain,\u201d she said.\n\nMarla dropped the hand.

Mara clipped the probe to a patch bay faceplate and watched the waterfall bloom. \u201cOkay. Map grid,\u201d she said, and taped off eight chalked letters along the hall\u2019s baseboard. She moved the probe from A to H, logging amplitudes, snapping photos.\nOver the PA, a woman\u2019s voice rolled in velvet. \u201cCan you feel it? The room remembering\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHold,\u201d Mara said.\nMarla rolled her eyes but lifted a hand to the staffer. The promo hung like perfume.\nMara\u2019s screen bled in a new comb at 540.3 MHz, teeth at 200 kHz intervals. Another lobe flared near 2.408 GHz. She nudged the probe toward the conduit that ducked into the east wall. The signal jumped.\n\u201cYour wireless pack?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cBlocks 24 through 26,\u201d Marla said, already scrolling her phone. \u201cWe\u2019re on 542.125 for the medium.

She palmed a thin feeler from her kit, listening to the corridor: rubber-soled steps, a whisper of a handcart, voices shelving books. The pick clicked. The drawer rolled an inch.\n\nInside: embossed invoices, a neat paperclip army. She photographed the stack, then slowed on the phrase that kept repeating: audio transducer, qty 24, 36, 48. Vendors with water names\u2014Brackish Group LLC, Estuary Integrations\u2014routing numbers masked by highlighter. Kline\u2019s tidy penciled checks in the margins: received, received, install?\n\n\u201cOffice closes at five,\u201d a staffer said, hovering in the doorway with a box of catalog cards.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m under the wire,\u201d Mara replied, and smiled without teeth.\n\nShe set the invoices side by side with her laptop, hotspot pulsing two grudging bars. A spreadsheet bloomed: vendor names, ABA codes, shells daisy-chaining through a community bank. She traced a payment hop to a consulting retainer with Rao\u2019s initials in the memo\u2014\u201cR.M. oversight\u201d\u2014and another to a private email she\u2019d seen in his bio. She flagged the rows, exported, watched the progress wheel stick and lurch. The signal dropped to one bar.\n\n\u201cJust a second,\u201d she murmured, relocking the drawer as the cart squeaked past. She shouldered the bag and moved\u2014library stacks, side door, gravel crunch\u2014to the boathouse.\n\nThe air there was brine and old rope. The locker row bore fresh scrapes; one door had crescent scuffs at knee height, paint abraded to raw wood. She measured the spacing with her phone case, photographed the gouges, the faint ghost of a shipping label peeled at the corner. The adhesive left an outline she could read by touch: TD-50. Her camera caught the scale\u2014the locker depth, the drag marks on the floor where something heavy had kissed the threshold. She crouched to see inside: salt grit, paper confetti, a stray desiccant pack.\n\n\u201cBoathouse is for staff only,\u201d someone called from outside.\n\n\u201cTwo minutes,\u201d she said, already walking backward, still shooting. \u201cPromise.\u201d\n\nOn the dock, the signal wavered. She climbed to the roofline ladder until the bay opened, her phone finally catching. She pinged Felix\u2019s burner\u2014silent, then a single dot appeared on her map history, time-stamped: 16:22, Granite Pier, end of the breakwater. She screen-captured the tile, dropped a pin, named it CACHE? Granite Pier sat across the cove like a plugged socket.\n\nBack in the office alcove where the Wi\u2011Fi reached, Mara stacked her proof: ledger flags on bulk transducers, shell payments bending toward Rao, and a locker scuffed by crates that matched the part code. She added the Granite Pier ping beneath. Money, hardware, waterside storage: three points, one line. She saved, backed up to two drives, and closed the laptop as the grandfather clock in the hall tolled the hour.",

        "generated_scene": "The east wing parlor breathed cold even before they dimmed the sconces. Marla stood at the hearth in her silk wrap, rings turned inward, her voice pitched to thread the room.\n\n\u201cOlivia, may I ask for stillness?\u201d\n\nOlivia knotted her fingers in her shawl. \u201cJust\u2014don\u2019t say my mother\u2019s name. Don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly what answers.\u201d Marla\u2019s smile was candlelight.\n\nThe vents sighed. A bass thrum woke inside the walls, not sound so much as a pressure behind the eyes. The lace on the side table rustled though the windows were shut, and a hairline creep of ash sketched across the cold grate.\n\nMara leaned in near Olivia\u2019s shoulder, keeping her tone a breath. \u201cThat\u2019s not a draft. Feel the frequency?\u201d\n\nOlivia\u2019s eyes shone and slid. \u201cMara\u2014please. If this is\u2026 if she\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n\nA picture frame knocked against plaster as if someone tapped it from inside. The horn interval she\u2019d logged last night rode under the thrum like a metronome. Mara\u2019s ear rang to the pitch, tinnitus answering the system.\n\nIn the hallway, Ortega\u2019s silhouette moved past, hands in his coat, doing his best impression of not-seeing.\n\nMarla\u2019s eyes fluttered shut. \u201cWho is present?\u201d\n\nThe vent above the chaise gave a single cough, and Olivia flinched hard enough to jolt the table. Teacups chimed. Her breath hitched\u2014too fast.\n\n\u201cStop,\u201d Olivia said, not to anyone in particular, and then louder, scrambling backward, \u201cStop.\u201d\n\nMarla didn\u2019t. The gauze she\u2019d tied to the chandelier stirred in a slow, unnatural loop.\n\n\u201cOlivia,\u201d Mara said, already moving. \u201cI need thirty seconds.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo do what?\u201d Olivia\u2019s voice snapped high with fear.\n\n\u201cTurn off the lie,\u201d Mara said, and slid toward the service door before anyone could grab the word.\n\nThe corridor was narrow, painted utility green, smelling of dust and lemon oil. She jogged past the linen carts to the HVAC subpanel, stripped wire labels taped like dog-eared flags. Her phone\u2019s flashlight found the breaker row. DUCT SUB 2 was handwritten, slanted, recent.\n\nBack in the parlor, the bass climbed. Olivia\u2019s panic tipped toward a sob.\n\nMara flipped DUCT SUB 2.\n\nSilence dropped like a canvas tarp. The gauze fell dead. The vent stopped coughing. The ash stilled. Marla\u2019s lids opened, calm dissolving into a hard professional flatness.\n\n\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Olivia said, cheeks blotched, looking both relieved and betrayed.\n\nMara returned, breathing carefully. \u201cCut an auxiliary. It\u2019s a speaker stuck to ductwork. It\u2019s all speakers.\u201d\n\nMarla\u2019s laugh came brittle. \u201cWe\u2019re sharing electricity now?\u201d\n\nA second beat. Then the rest of the room adjusted\u2014another tone threaded in from the far wall, faint but there, a residual hum from somewhere she hadn\u2019t traced. The chandelier ticked with settling metal.\n\nMarla lifted her chin. \u201cWe\u2019ll take five,\u201d she said to no one and everyone. She turned to her assistant in the doorway, a shadow with a road case. \u201cAlternate. Soft line. No duct.\u201d\n\nThe assistant vanished down the hall, quick.\n\nOlivia stepped toward Mara, chest rising and falling. \u201cYou said you were observing, not sabotaging.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m keeping you upright,\u201d Mara said. \u201cYou were about to faint.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get to decide how this happens in my house,\u201d Olivia said, and it landed harder than volume.\n\nFrom the corridor, a relay popped\u2014different panel, different feed. In Mara\u2019s ear, her phone app blinked: the little RF bars she\u2019d been watching went flat. When they came back, they were scrambled, channels remapped, labels wiped. Someone had closed a loop she\u2019d been piggybacking.\n\nMarla smiled again, silk back in her voice. \u201cShall we begin, Olivia?\u201d\n\nMara stood with her hands out and empty, hearing only the part of the room they let her hear.",

Her breath hitched\u2014too fast.\n\u201cStop,\u201d Olivia said, not to anyone in particular, and then louder, scrambling backward, \u201cStop.\u201d\nMarla didn\u2019t. The gauze she\u2019d tied to the chandelier stirred in a slow, unnatural loop.\n\u201cOlivia,\u201d Mara said, already moving. \u201cI need thirty seconds.\u201d\n\u201cTo do what?\u201d Olivia\u2019s voice snapped high with fear.\n\u201cTurn off the lie,\u201d Mara said, and slid toward the service door before anyone could grab the word.\nThe corridor was narrow, painted utility green, smelling of dust and lemon oil. She jogged past the linen carts to the HVAC subpanel, stripped wire labels taped like dog-eared flags. Her phone\u2019s flashlight found the breaker row. DUCT SUB 2 was handwritten, slanted, recent.\nBack in the parlor, the bass climbed. Olivia\u2019s panic tipped toward a sob.\nMara flipped DUCT SUB 2.\nSilence dropped like a canvas tarp. The gauze fell dead. The vent stopped coughing. The ash stilled. Marla\u2019s lids opened, calm dissolving into a hard professional flatness.\n\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Olivia said, cheeks blotched, looking both relieved and betrayed.\nMara returned, breathing carefully. \u201cCut an auxiliary. It\u2019s a speaker stuck to ductwork. It\u2019s all speakers.\u201d\nand Olivia flinched hard enough to jolt the table. Teacups chimed. Her breath hitched\u2014too fast.\nA second beat. Then the rest of the room adjusted\u2014another tone threaded in from the far wall, faint but there, a residual hum from somewhere she hadn\u2019t traced. The chandelier ticked with settling metal.\nMarla lifted her chin. \u201cWe\u2019ll take five,\u201d she said to no one and everyone. She turned to her assistant in the doorway, a shadow with a road case. \u201cAlternate. Soft line. No duct.\u201d\nThe assistant vanished down the hall, quick.\nOlivia stepped toward Mara, chest rising and falling. \u201cYou said you were observing, not sabotaging.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m keeping you upright,\u201d Mara said. \u201cYou were about to faint.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get to decide how this happens in my house,\u201d Olivia said, and it landed harder than volume.\nFrom the corridor, a relay popped\u2014different panel, different feed. In Mara\u2019s ear, her phone app blinked: the little RF bars she\u2019d been watching went flat. When they came back, they were scrambled, channels remapped, labels wiped. Someone had closed a loop she\u2019d been piggybacking.\nMarla smiled again, silk back in her voice. \u201cShall we begin, Olivia?\u201d\nMara stood with her hands out and empty, hearing only the part of the room they let her hear.\"\"\""

        "generated_scene": "Night had gone thin and metallic. Mara lay on her side in the east-wing service alcove, shoulder wedged to a cold pipe, breath timed to the dull cycle of the boiler. Her phone\u2019s camera sat on a magnet clamp at her cheek, red tally dot steady. She pressed two fingers to the latch cavity cut into the back of the door frame\u2014paint score-marks fresh, screws with new bluing. Under the strike plate, a thread of bell wire gleamed where someone had tin-soldered it to the latch tongue.\n\n\u201cGot you,\u201d she whispered, mostly for the mic.\n\nShe eased the plate back, one screw at a time, capturing each with a strip of painter\u2019s tape so they wouldn\u2019t ping on tile. The cavity smelled of rosin. The wire was old-cloth insulated until the last inch, where it went shiny and raw, looped neat through a drilled hole, and tied off like a surgeon\u2019s knot.\n\nShe filmed the knot, the solder bead, the heat bloom on the brass. \u201cRecent work,\u201d she said, keeping voice low, consonants clipped. \u201cAssist wire\u2014traction to latch tongue.\u201d\n\nIn the corridor beyond the panel, someone\u2019s steps passed, the floorboards giving a polite, sympathetic creak. Mara\u2019s spine went rigid against the pipe. She thumbed the phone light off, sealed in dark, counting the footfalls until the sound dissolved into the stairwell\u2019s hush. When she brought the light back, her hands felt larger than they were. She set the plate back with its screws three-quarters home and slipped out, flattening herself to the utility molding. The east corridor ran quiet and walnut-dark to the grand stair.\n\nAt the newel, she pulled a coil from her pocket: white yacht line, slick as tendon. The banister\u2019s inside curve bore crescent scars, each one aligned, each one shallow, like a careful mistake repeated. She fed the line low around the newel, keeping it seated in the groove of damage, then snaked it along the baseboard to the latch cavity. The bell wire\u2019s free tag waited. She tied the two with a compact bend and checked the load path\u2014around the newel, along the run, into the latch tongue.\n\nShe filmed her hands. \u201cPath reproduces gouge geometry. Pulley effect via newel. Remote actuation.\u201d\n\nAnother board sighed upstairs. She froze again, then braced her foot, took the line like a halyard, and gave it a slow, even pull.\n\nThe door whispered, then clicked. The latch tongue slid back, obedient. In her phone mic, the sound was a clean metallic sip.\n\nShe eased off. Let it seat. Pulled again, smaller, feeling the wire stretch a hair, the tongue travel, the catch release. The gouges took the angle of load; the line hummed faintly against varnish. She stepped to the far end of the corridor and tried it from there, hand low, tugging with two fingers. Click. The same.\n\nMara\u2019s breathing finally showed in the shot, fogging the black. She cut the knot and reeled the line, rewound it to its compact coil, retaped the strike plate flush. She held the camera once more on the damage: solder bright, rope bites scrolled like a secret code. Then she whispered, flat and satisfied, \u201cMechanism confirmed,\u201d and slipped back into the alcove\u2019s shadow to file the clip.",

The nor\u2019easter shuddered against Harbor House, guttering light across the walnut banister, the crescent scars along its inside curve pale as old teeth.\n\nMara cupped a thumb-sized pinhole cam under the lip of the picture rail, pressed its adhesive pad, and felt it take. A blink\u2014green to black\u2014disappeared it into shadow. She eased along the wall, counting boards, noting sightlines. Another cam nested in the throat of a carved acanthus at the stair post. A third went low, a black dot inside the brass rosette of a floor vent.\n\n\u201cMs. Keene.\u201d Olivia\u2019s voice was level behind her. \u201cYou promised minimal intrusion.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo drills,\u201d Mara said. \u201cNo nails. Just optics.\u201d She kept her tone uninflected, her hands steady. Tape hissed soft as breath.\n\nFrom the parlor, a spoon chimed the rim of a glass. Marla, in velvet that drank candlelight, smiled too widely for the room. \u201cFriends\u2014if we\u2019re to be courteous to the dead, let\u2019s start on time.\u201d\n\nWind banged a shutter. The lamps blinked, recovered, trembling in their shades.\n\nOlivia stepped closer, her perfume salt and iris over damp wood. \u201cYou are not planting surveillance on my guests.\u201d\n\n\u201cAcoustic baselines,\u201d Mara said. She slid a credit-card decibel meter from her sleeve and tucked it into the belly of a blue-and-white jar on the landing table, the lid\u2019s dragon mouths aiming the slit toward the corridor. \u201cWe log knocks, we don\u2019t interpret them.\u201d\n\nOlivia looked at the jar, then at Mara. \u201cI don\u2019t like being handled.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen don\u2019t be,\u201d Mara said. She checked her phone: each camera returned a grainy slice\u2014stair run, landing corners, the east door\u2019s polished throat. She typed a thumbed cue: Go loud on the legend, soft on the tech. Stall ten.\n\nMarla\u2019s voice deepened. \u201cThis house has always listened,\u201d she told the semicircle in the parlor\u2014Kline with his ledger-creased hands, Felix bored and coiled, two guests clutching napkins. \u201cTonight, we listen back.\u201d\n\nMara drifted to the parlor threshold and ghosted another cam into the bead of a wall sconce, twisting it to catch the east doorway. She held up a gauze pouch of iron keys. \u201cProps,\u201d she said to Olivia, letting the lie be thin enough to breathe. \u201cNo one loves pure audio.\u201d\n\nOlivia folded her arms. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t see you hiding your little fish eyes?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019d rather I hide them well,\u201d Mara said. \u201cFor effect.\u201d\n\nMarla dimmed the lamps to amber. The storm gave a long, wet moan through the chimney, a bass that tickled glass. \u201cIf anyone hears a name, you say it,\u201d Marla told the circle. \u201cIf you feel a draft, you welcome it.\u201d\n\nMara stepped back to the landing and palmed the last cam under the newel\u2019s underside. Her phone showed her the room in nine-inch truths: candleflame, knuckles, the critical door. The decibel graph twitched with the house\u2019s throat-clears.\n\nOlivia didn\u2019t leave. She took a chair at the parlor\u2019s edge, spine straight, eyes on Marla, then on Mara, then on the east hall. \u201cVery well,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we\u2019re doing this, we\u2019ll do it properly.\u201d\n\nMarla shut her eyes, hands hovering above the table like tuning forks. \u201cHarbor House,\u201d she said, barely above the rain, \u201cwe\u2019re with you.\u201d The circle breathed in, a long intake that seemed to pull the weather closer.\n\nMara slid her phone into her palm and let her face go blank. The gear was down. The show had begun. The house buzzed, charged and waiting. Olivia watched, suspicious but still.",

She took a chair at the parlor\u2019s edge, spine straight, eyes on Marla, then on Mara, then on the east hall. \u201cVery well,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we\u2019re doing this, we\u2019ll do it properly.\u201d\nMarla shut her eyes, hands hovering above the table like tuning forks. \u201cHarbor House,\u201d she said, barely above the rain, \u201cwe\u2019re with you.\u201d The circle breathed in, a long intake that seemed to pull the weather closer.\nMara slid her phone into her palm and let her face go blank. The gear was down. The show had begun. The house buzzed, charged and waiting. Olivia watched, suspicious but still.\"\"\""

        "generated_scene": "The jar\u2019s meter ticked up and down with the weather\u2014rain drumming, chimney bass, a hiss where the hall narrowed. At 9:12 p.m., Marla\u2019s voice rolled in from the parlor, warm and slow. \u201cKnock if you\u2019re with us.\u201d\n\nThree taps came from the east wing, wood on hollow wood. The decibel graph spiked, clean little teeth.\n\nMara stood in the corridor between the stairwell and the east door, shoulder to the wainscot, phone tilted low. On her screen: four feeds\u2014newel underside, stair run, sconce bead, the east plate\u2019s bevel. The lock\u2019s strike filled a quarter of one frame like a chrome mouth.\n\nMarla again: \u201cKnock twice for yes, once for no.\u201d\n\nTwo. Then one. Then a flourish like someone showing off.\n\nMara breathed once and thumbed a text: Hold them at table. Give me three rounds. Emphasize names.\n\nFrom the parlor, Marla purred, \u201cOlivia, hear that? Say your grandfather\u2019s name.\u201d\n\nOlivia, off, clipped: \u201cI decline.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen the house may choose.\u201d Marla let the circle murmur.\n\nMara slid closer to the stair. Storm noise fattened, the roof booming. She checked the jar graph: the knocks sat at a higher frequency band than the rain, sharp little transients. Good separation. She set an auto-clip at 20 dB above baseline, 100 ms window.\n\nOn the east feed, the latch trembled. A twitch inside the plate. At 9:18, the actuator jumped\u2014half a centimeter of clean mechanical draw\u2014and the lock snicked open. The sound vanished into thunder, but the meter spiked, and the camera caught the relay\u2019s miniature piston retracting and releasing. In the stairwell feed, the newel shadow moved: a line, taut, then slack.\n\nMara didn\u2019t look up. She pinched the screen and tagged the frame: RELAY ACTUATION, 9:18:07. She let the hall be empty.\n\n\u201cAgain,\u201d Marla said. \u201cIf you can shift the air, do it.\u201d\n\nThe east door settled back as if chastened. The latch eased, then kissed the strike. A pause, then one soft celebratory tap from the panel, like a thank-you.\n\nMara crouched by the banister where the gouges showed pale and fibrous against old shellac. She flicked her penlight. Lodged along the cut: translucent strands feathering like hair, too clean for cedar, too straight for hemp. She unzipped a pouch, drew tweezers, and teased three filaments free. They clung with static. She dropped them into a glassine, labeled: E-WING BANISTER GOUGE, 9:21, E-glass?\n\nFrom the parlor, Olivia: \u201cWhat are you doing out there?\u201d\n\n\u201cLogging,\u201d Mara called, neutral. \u201cStair draft.\u201d\n\nMarla covered with a soft run of patter about tides and listening.\n\nThe jar\u2019s graph jittered. Mara held until the weather fell back. She sent one more cue: One last set. Build to threes.\n\nMarla obliged. The house gave three brisk knocks. The relay popped once more, a quick dry kiss, and the east plate flickered with movement. Clearer this time; the thunder lagged.\n\nMara tagged the clip, saved redundant copies, sealed the glassine with a press of her thumbnail. Control held. Exposure achieved. She slid the pouch into her pocket and took one step back into the stair\u2019s cool echo, the cameras blinking their little truths. 9:26 p.m.",

        "generated_scene": "The house went dark as if a lung collapsed. The chandeliers died, the jar screens blinked to night, and the storm rushed in louder, a sheet of noise against old wood.\n\n\u201cPower?\u201d Olivia\u2019s voice snapped from the parlor. \u201cWho did that\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMain breaker,\u201d Mara said, already moving, her phone light a dime of milk. Staff murmured, chairs scraped. A metal tray clanged somewhere like a dropped cymbal.\n\nFelix appeared as a shape with edges, a pale face under a hood. Marla\u2019s open laptop lay under his arm like a stolen book. He didn\u2019t look at Mara. \u201cSorry,\u201d he told the air, and slipped past a swinging door into the service corridor.\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d Mara lunged, shoulder clipping the jamb, and followed. The corridor breathed cold detergent and old onions. Her beam skittered over racks, mops, the glare of EXIT signs gummy with dust. Ahead, Felix\u2019s light remained off\u2014a darker dark that moved.\n\n\u201cRao,\u201d Felix hissed into his collar, \u201ckill it.\u201d\n\nOn the other end, a calm voice: \u201cInitiated. Wipe one of three. Sixty seconds.\u201d\n\nMara\u2019s thumb flew on glass: hotspot, scan. No house Wi-Fi; the AP light dead. She killed her own screen and ran by memory, hand sliding along tile, toe catching on a buckled mat. \u201cOlivia, keep everyone at table!\u201d she shouted back. \u201cCount heads!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is happening?\u201d Olivia again, smaller with distance.\n\n\u201cA theft,\u201d Mara said, breath rounding the word. \u201cStay put.\u201d\n\nFelix took the service stairs two at a time, boots thudding. Rain sharpened as the door at the bottom banged open, the storm thrusting fingers of water up the steps. Mara beat after him, heat in her face, the air a river.\n\nOutside was black-on-black, the grounds reduced to shape and temperature. The boathouse lights were gone; the storm made its own dim geometry. Felix cut left along the gravel path, the crunch giving him away. Mara splashed after, shoes filling. Wind shoved her sideways, hard.\n\n\u201cWipe two initiating,\u201d Rao said, voice tinny. \u201cDon\u2019t plug it in. Do not connect.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot touching anything,\u201d Felix said, breath steady, a runner in night.\n\nMara angled her light low: tracks in water, the suggestion of crushed shells glimmering when the beam found them. \u201cFelix!\u201d she called. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to burn it. We just talk.\u201d\n\nHe laughed without slowing. \u201cWe\u2019re done talking.\u201d\n\nThe boathouse showed itself as a darker block against the bay. Rope snapped against cleats. The door had a padlock, but Felix had a key, a small punctual sound against the weather. He slipped in and vanished, the door breathing once on its hinges.\n\nMara hit the plank and nearly went down; algae slick as soap. She caught the railing, palm biting on a screw head, and swore. The phone light swung wild, caught a gull wing nailed to a post, then nothing.\n\nInside: the faint ghost of a screen, then black. Rao, crisp: \u201cApp payload shredded. Final pass. Thirty percent.\u201d\n\nMara pushed the door. It held. She put her shoulder to it and it opened grudging inches, wind fighting her. Felix\u2019s silhouette moved deeper in the dark, a cable coiled over his shoulder like a pet snake.\n\n\u201cStop,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d he said, not unkind.\n\nBehind her the storm rose to a sheet of needles. Her beam stuttered on spray and wood and a wet floor that refused traction. She could hear typing, decision, the hard quiet of a man doing a thing and finishing it.\n\n\u201cFinal pass,\u201d Rao said. \u201cNinety.\u201d\n\nMara felt the night lean. She shoved forward and slid, caught herself on a boat cradle, breath torn thin. The laptop\u2019s lid flashed once as if winking, then shut. Felix lifted it again, shoulders set.\n\n\u201cDone,\u201d Rao said. \u201cIt\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\nMara swallowed wind and salt and the fact of it. Felix moved toward the dock side, already turning away, rain making a silver noise on everything. She was close enough to see the water run off his jaw, and not close enough to reach him.",

        "generated_scene": "Wind knifed through the boathouse slats, turning breath to grit. Felix shouldered the skiff along its cradle, laptop clamped in the crook of his arm, one hand dragging the cable like a tail. The culvert gate clanged as he hit the lever.\n\nNothing moved.\n\nFrom the shadows under the winch, Caleb\u2019s voice: \u201cTry it again, champ.\u201d\n\nFelix\u2019s head snapped up. \u201cCaleb\u2014\u201d\n\nCaleb stepped into Mara\u2019s beam, soaked to the ribs, hand white-knuckled around a length of galvanized rod wedged through the gear teeth. The tide shouldered at the gate in dull heaves. \u201cYou don\u2019t launch tonight.\u201d\n\nFelix ground the lever. The rod rang, held. He swore, pivoted, and shoved the skiff toward the dock apron instead, aiming for open water past the pilings.\n\nMara moved to cut him off, soles skating. Spray swept the dock and vanished into dark. \u201cFelix. Hand me the laptop.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet off the apron,\u201d he shot back. \u201cI mean it.\u201d\n\nCaleb came at him from the side. Felix feinted low, surprising quick, scraping the skiff\u2019s bow past. The laptop slipped, he snatched it, and for an instant his fingers were only screen and rain.\n\nMara lunged. Her palm hit the lid. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s dead,\u201d he said, teeth bared. \u201cYou heard it. Let go.\u201d\n\nA gust shoved them sideways as one. The skiff slammed the dock edge. Rope sang on a cleat. Under the boards, the bay talked, a deep, indifferent chuckle.\n\nFelix yanked free and ran for the lip where the apron opened to black. He drew the laptop back, ready to pitch.\n\nCaleb hit him in the waist, a clean tackle that folded them both. The laptop flew, skittered, and teetered on the brink like a fish flashing silver.\n\nMara left her feet. She slid belly-first, fingers out, and clapped both hands around the machine at the last inch. The corner bit her palm. She hauled, boots kicking for purchase, salt in her mouth.\n\n\u201cGot it,\u201d she spat.\n\nFelix twisted under Caleb, feral, heel hammering at Caleb\u2019s thigh. \u201cOff!\u201d\n\n\u201cStay down,\u201d Caleb grunted, tightening an arm around Felix\u2019s shoulders. Felix drove an elbow back; it thunked bone. Caleb hissed and shifted, using his weight, cheek mashed to wet wood. \u201cMara?\u201d\n\nShe crawled backward, clutching the laptop to her jacket. The cable snaked after and snagged a cleat; she tore it free. Felix saw it and surged again, a last try for the edge.\n\nMara set the laptop on the bench, turned back, and went for his wrist as he bridged. \u201cFelix. Enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2014go\u2014\u201d His breath broke on each word.\n\n\u201cNot tonight,\u201d Caleb said, and cinched. Felix\u2019s fight ran thin. The storm filled the space where his breath had been.\n\nMara pressed his free hand to the planks until the tendons stopped jumping. She met his eyes, rain beating their faces to blur. \u201cWe\u2019re done.\u201d\n\nCaleb nodded without looking up. \u201cLaptop?\u201d\n\n\u201cSecured,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s pinned.\u201d",

(+)\"\"\"\n\nHere is the ending of the previous scene:\n\"\"\"Caleb stepped into Mara\u2019s beam, soaked to the ribs, hand white-knuckled around a length of galvanized rod wedged through the gear teeth. The tide shouldered at the gate in dull heaves. \u201cYou don\u2019t launch tonight.\u201d\nFelix ground the lever. The rod rang, held. He swore, pivoted, and shoved the skiff toward the dock apron instead, aiming for open water past the pilings.\nMara moved to cut him off, soles skating. Spray swept the dock and vanished into dark. \u201cFelix. Hand me the laptop.\u201d\n\u201cGet off the apron,\u201d he shot back. \u201cI mean it.\u201d\nCaleb came at him from the side. Felix feinted low, surprising quick, scraping the skiff\u2019s bow past. The laptop slipped, he snatched it, and for an instant his fingers were only screen and rain.\nMara lunged. Her palm hit the lid. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s dead,\u201d he said, teeth bared. \u201cYou heard it. Let go.\u201d\nA gust shoved them sideways as one. The skiff slammed the dock edge. Rope sang on a cleat. Under the boards, the bay talked, a deep, indifferent chuckle.\nFelix yanked free and ran for the lip where the apron opened to black. He drew the laptop back, ready to pitch.\nCaleb hit him in the waist, a clean tackle that folded them both. The laptop flew, skittered, and teetered on the brink like a fish flashing silver.\nMara left her feet. She slid belly-first, fingers out, and clapped both hands around the machine at the last inch. The corner bit her palm. She hauled, boots kicking for purchase, salt in her mouth.\n\u201cGot it,\u201d she spat.\nFelix twisted under Caleb, feral, heel hammering at Caleb\u2019s thigh. \u201cOff!\u201d\n\u201cStay down,\u201d Caleb grunted, tightening an arm around Felix\u2019s shoulders. Felix drove an elbow back; it thunked bone. Caleb hissed and shifted, using his weight, cheek mashed to wet wood. \u201cMara?\u201d\nShe crawled backward, clutching the laptop to her jacket. The cable snaked after and snagged a cleat; she tore it free. Felix saw it and surged again, a last try for the edge.\nMara set the laptop on the bench, turned back, and went for his wrist as he bridged. \u201cFelix.

Mara set the laptop on the long oak table beside her camera and a plastic bag with the yacht line fibers she\u2019d taped from the banister gouges. Ortega stood opposite, shoulders squared, not bothering with a coat. Kline and Olivia watched from the hearth, stiff as portraits. Caleb leaned on the doorframe, panting quietly through the bruise rising on his cheek.\n\nFelix sat, wrists on his knees, jaw clenched. Rao hovered a step behind him, blinking water from his lashes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be quick,\u201d Mara said, voice flat. She opened her camera and scrolled to the photo of the bell wire laced to the east-wing latch, the solder still glassy. \u201cRao\u2019s diagram. You taped it to the junction box,\u201d she added, sliding to the shot of the schematic with his handwriting, the relay labeled E-W LOCK. \u201cDated three nights ago. Ten thirty-one p.m.\u201d\n\nRao\u2019s lips shaped a no before sound came. \u201cThat drawing is part of an acoustics study. It proves nothing.\u201d\n\nOrtega\u2019s pen ticked. \u201cYou told me earlier you\u2019d never been in that alcove.\u201d\n\nMara tapped the screen again, bringing up a map overlaid with cell pings. \u201cBurner one, registered to a shell that pays Rao Consulting through two cutouts\u2014Black Cormorant LLC and Pierson Capital. Pings at Granite Pier at 7:12 on Wednesday\u201d\u2014she flicked\u2014\u201cand at Harbor House service door at 9:58. Burner two,\u201d she added, eyes on Felix, \u201chits Granite Pier at 7:14, east lawn at 9:59, boathouse at 10:03.\u201d\n\nFelix laughed, a dry bark. \u201cYou\u2019ve got colored dots and rain. That\u2019s your case?\u201d\n\nMara hit play on a clip. The decibel meter spiked. A muted clack sounded, followed by the latch popping on camera. \u201cRelay snap at 10:13 tonight. Here\u2019s the chain: Kline\u2019s ledger shows bulk \u2018audio transducers\u2019 billed to Pierson, delivered to the boathouse locker with these scuffs,\u201d she said, tapping the photo of fresh rubs inside the locker. \u201cFelix\u2019s key, Felix\u2019s locker. Yacht line matching these fibers run around the newel to pull the lock. Payment lands in Rao\u2019s account twelve minutes after the Granite Pier ping.\u201d\n\nRao\u2019s face hardened. \u201cYou will be sued into vapor. You accessed proprietary systems without consent.\u201d\n\n\u201cOlivia consented,\u201d Ortega said, without turning. \u201cTwice.\u201d\n\nOlivia nodded, hoarse. \u201cI did.\u201d\n\nKline swallowed. \u201cAnd those ledgers were mine to hand over. I did.\u201d\n\nMara slid the laptop across. \u201cFelix attempted to destroy this. Cache held. Control app was wiped, but the system log writes locally first. It shows UID \u2018labfelix\u2019 authorizing the east-wing test. Time-stamped 10:10.\u201d\n\nFelix surged to his feet. \u201cLawyer.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat,\u201d Ortega said, calm as ice. He stepped in, took Felix\u2019s wrists, and clicked cuffs with a decisive, domestic sound. \u201cFelix Morrell, you\u2019re under arrest for burglary, criminal mischief, and conspiracy to defraud. Rao Nandakumar, same charges.\u201d\n\nRao flinched when the steel touched. \u201cThis is\u2014Olivia, tell him.\u201d\n\nOlivia didn\u2019t move. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nCaleb lifted the plastic bag with the fibers. \u201cYou want this logged?\u201d\n\n\u201cBag it, tag it, sign it,\u201d Ortega said. He met Mara\u2019s eyes. \u201cChain starts now.\u201d\n\nMara handed over the camera, the map printouts, the laptop. \u201cAll yours.\u201d\n\nThe storm went on rapping the panes. Inside, it was very quiet.",
