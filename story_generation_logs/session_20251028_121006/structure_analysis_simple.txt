SIMPLE STRUCTURE ANALYSIS
Session: 20251028_121006
================================================================================

THE CORE PLOT (2-3 sentences max)
A forensic investigator is hired to assess “hauntings” at a coastal estate and proves they’re engineered with hidden audio, HVAC coupling, and a remote latch mechanism. She tracks the gear and payments to a tech consultant and a staffer, intercepts a data wipe, and they’re arrested for staging phenomena to defraud.

MAIN CHARACTERS (3-5 people max)
- Mara (Voss/Keene): Contract investigator who methodically documents and exposes the staged hauntings.
- Olivia Crane: Estate head torn between believing and needing control; authorizes the investigation.
- Ortega: Security chief who enforces access, then executes the arrests.
- Felix Morrell: Charming staffer tied to keys, lockers, and the control app; tries to destroy evidence.
- Rao Nandakumar: Outside consultant who designs the relay/audio system and coordinates the wipe.

KEY EVENTS (5-8 beats)
1) Mara negotiates access and establishes technical baselines (hum, horn intervals).
2) She documents tampered seals, jammed windows, and gouged banister—signs of a remote latch scheme.
3) Discrepancies in ledgers and shell vendors reveal bulk “audio transducers” routed off-books.
4) RF mapping shows the séance PA coupling into HVAC, propagating effects; she kills a duct feed mid-demo.
5) She proves a mechanical assist: bell wire to latch, rope path around the newel; confirms remote door actuation on camera.
6) Cameras capture the staged “knocks” and relay firing during the séance; fibers from the gouges are collected.
7) Power is cut; Felix flees with Marla’s laptop while Rao wipes data; in a storm chase, Mara and Caleb secure the laptop.
8) Mara links gear, payments, pings, and system logs to Felix and Rao; Ortega arrests them.

STORY TYPE
Modern investigative mystery/tech thriller: Are the hauntings real, or an engineered con—and who’s running it?

ISSUES (if any)
- Mara is called both “Ms. Voss” and “Ms. Keene.”
- Kline’s role in the dual ledgers is ambiguous; complicit or “prudence” remains unresolved.
- Marla’s knowledge/complicity is unclear; she isn’t charged.
