  "structure_analysis_simple": "THE CORE PLOT (2-3 sentences max)\nA forensic investigator is hired to assess “hauntings” at a coastal estate and proves they’re engineered with hidden audio, HVAC coupling, and a remote latch mechanism. She tracks the gear and payments to a tech consultant and a staffer, intercepts a data wipe, and they’re arrested for staging phenomena to defraud.\n\nMAIN CHARACTERS (3-5 people max)\n- Mara (Voss/Keene): Contract investigator who methodically documents and exposes the staged hauntings.\n- Olivia Crane: Estate head torn between believing and needing control; authorizes the investigation.\n- Ortega: Security chief who enforces access, then executes the arrests.\n- Felix Morrell: Charming staffer tied to keys, lockers, and the control app; tries to destroy evidence.\n- Rao Nandakumar: Outside consultant who designs the relay/audio system and coordinates the wipe.\n\nKEY EVENTS (5-8 beats)\n1) Mara negotiates access and establishes technical baselines (hum, horn intervals).\n2) She documents tampered seals, jammed windows, and gouged banister—signs of a remote latch scheme.\n3) Discrepancies in ledgers and shell vendors reveal bulk “audio transducers” routed off-books.\n4) RF mapping shows the séance PA coupling into HVAC, propagating effects; she kills a duct feed mid-demo.\n5) She proves a mechanical assist: bell wire to latch, rope path around the newel; confirms remote door actuation on camera.\n6) Cameras capture the staged “knocks” and relay firing during the séance; fibers from the gouges are collected.\n7) Power is cut; Felix flees with Marla’s laptop while Rao wipes data; in a storm chase, Mara and Caleb secure the laptop.\n8) Mara links gear, payments, pings, and system logs to Felix and Rao; Ortega arrests them.\n\nSTORY TYPE\nModern investigative mystery/tech thriller: Are the hauntings real, or an engineered con—and who’s running it?\n\nISSUES (if any)\n- Mara is called both “Ms. Voss” and “Ms. Keene.”\n- Kline’s role in the dual ledgers is ambiguous; complicit or “prudence” remains unresolved.\n- Marla’s knowledge/complicity is unclear; she isn’t charged."
