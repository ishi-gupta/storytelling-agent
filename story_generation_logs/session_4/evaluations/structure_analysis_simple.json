Stranded in 1969, she tries to rebuild the technology from memory but realizes the supporting infrastructure doesn't exist yet. She ultimately confesses to the inventor and pivots to teaching principles for a slower, more thoughtful technological evolution.\n\n## MAIN CHARACTERS (3-5 people max)\n- **Maya Chen**: Time traveler from 2025 whose mistake destroys computing history; learns to accept and guide rather than control\n- **Douglas Engelbart**: Real historical figure, computer scientist whose lab burns down; surprisingly accepting of Maya's confession\n- **Bill English**: Engelbart's engineer who grows suspicious of Maya's advanced knowledge but subplot isn't resolved\n\n## KEY EVENTS (5-8 beats)\n1. Maya time-travels to 1969 to witness the first computer mouse demonstration\n2. Her temporal device malfunctions, causing an electrical surge and fire\n3. Engelbart's lab and all prototypes are destroyed; Maya is stranded in the past\n4. Maya attempts to rebuild the mouse from memory over two weeks\n5. She realizes the necessary components and infrastructure won't exist for decades\n6. Maya confesses the truth to Engelbart\n7. They decide to document principles rather than implementations, accepting a different technological timeline\n\n## STORY TYPE\nScience fiction time travel story exploring the theme \"what if we lost the internet before it was invented?\" with focus on unintended consequences and accepting outcomes we can't control.\n\n## ISSUES (if any)\n- Karen Zhao (colleague mentioned in setup) never appears despite being set up as trying to fix things from 2025\n- Bill English's suspicions are raised but never addressed or resolved\n- We don't see any consequences of the alternate 2025 timeline Maya created\n- Time travel rules unclear (why can't she just try again with better equipment?)"
