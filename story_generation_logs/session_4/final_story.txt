Chapter 1, Scene 1

The temporal shimmer faded, leaving Maya Chen standing in a sun-baked parking lot that smelled of asphalt and possibilities. Through the glass doors of the Stanford Research Institute, history was about to be made—again, for the first time, depending on how you counted.

She smoothed her carefully researched 1969-appropriate dress and clipped on the visitor badge she'd fabricated. "Consultant, Bay Area Computing Initiative," it read. The lie tasted bitter but necessary.

Inside, Douglas Engelbart stood before a projection screen, his hand resting on a wooden box with a single red button. The Mother of All Demos. Maya's throat tightened.

"This is a mouse," Engelbart said, his voice crackling through the PA system. The audience—maybe forty people—leaned forward. Maya memorized every face, every reaction, fighting the urge to take notes that wouldn't exist for another fifty years.

The cursor moved. Smooth. Perfect. Revolutionary.

Her temporal anchor vibrated against her ribs. A warning. She had maybe ten minutes before automatic recall. Ten minutes to witness the moment that would shape everything.

Bill English caught her staring and nodded politely. Maya tried to smile back, but her device was heating up, faster than it should. The equations scrolled through her mind. Something was wrong.

Very wrong.


Chapter 2, Scene 1

The smell of burning insulation hit her first.

Maya's anchor had gone from warm to scalding in thirty seconds. Through the demonstration hall windows, she saw smoke curling from the equipment room. The surge protectors—primitive by her standards, nonexistent by 1969's—had failed catastrophically.

"Fire!" someone shouted.

Engelbart abandoned his mouse, rushing toward the smoke. Maya ran after him, her heart a drumbeat of no-no-no. The equations were clear now, brutally so: her arrival had created a localized electromagnetic pulse. The lab's electrical system couldn't handle it.

Inside the equipment room, flames licked at cabinets full of prototypes. Decades of work. The foundation of networked computing. All burning.

"Get Engelbart out!" Maya grabbed Bill English's arm. "The oxygen tanks—"

"How do you know about—"

The explosion was small but decisive. Fire suppression systems—also primitive—activated too late. By the time the fire department arrived, the lab was a smoking shell.

Engelbart sat on the curb, soot-streaked, staring at his hands. The mouse was ash. The terminals were slag. And Maya's temporal anchor was dead, its fail-safe triggered by the pulse, stranding her.

In trying to witness history, she'd erased it.


Chapter 3, Scene 1

The makeshift workshop smelled like solder and disappointment.

"The ball bearing needs to be precisely machined," Maya said, adjusting her—their—third attempt at reconstructing the mouse. "But the CNC equipment won't be commercially available for another—"

"Another what?" Bill English looked up from his circuit diagrams, eyes narrowed. "You seem to know a lot about future manufacturing."

Maya's hand slipped. The bearing rolled across the workbench. She'd been sloppy, too eager to fix her mistake. Two weeks of trying to rebuild from memory, and all she'd managed was to raise suspicions.

"I studied at MIT," she lied. "Theoretical work. Projections about miniaturization."

"Theoretical." Bill didn't sound convinced. He picked up her sketch of a circuit board. "This looks like something from a science fiction magazine."

Because it is, she wanted to say. Because I come from a world where your prototypes became the foundation of global communication. Because I destroyed that timeline and I'm trying desperately to rebuild it before—

Before what? Before the internet never happened? Too late.

The prototype mouse twitched, moved an inch, then died. Without the infrastructure—the chips, the protocols, the networks—individual components were just expensive paperweights.

"It's not going to work," Maya whispered. "Not like this. Not for decades."


Chapter 4, Scene 1

The coffee was terrible, but Douglas Engelbart drank it anyway. Across the Formica table, Maya Chen finally stopped lying.

"I'm from the future," she said. "Fifty-six years. The fire was my fault. I came to see your demo and I destroyed it instead."

She waited for him to call security, to laugh, to walk away. Instead, he stirred his coffee and asked, "How far did we get? Before you changed things?"

"You revolutionized computing. The mouse became ubiquitous. Your work enabled the internet, connected the entire planet." She pulled out a folded paper covered in diagrams. "This is what you would have built. This is what I took from you."

Engelbart studied the drawings—networks of networks, protocols, graphical interfaces. His eyes glistened.

"No," he said finally. "This is what we took from ourselves. Too fast, probably. Without thinking about what it meant." He pushed the paper back. "You did me a favor."

"What?"

"Show me the principles. Not the implementation. Teach me to think about connecting humans, not just machines. Let's take the long way." He smiled, sad but genuine. "Maybe we'll get it right this time."

Maya folded the diagrams and slipped them into her purse. Tomorrow, she'd burn them. Tonight, she'd start teaching a different kind of future—one where technology served human connection instead of replacing it.

The internet would come eventually. But this time, they'd be ready for it.
