Character & Motivation Judge

Evaluates character depth, consistency, and psychological realism.
Every good story is driven by good characters.

1. Character Consistency:
   - Are character motivations clear throughout the story?
   - Do characters act consistently with their incentives?

2. Human Psychology:
   - Do characters act reasonably given human psychology?
   - Are their reactions and decisions believable?

3. Character Design:
   - Are characters interesting and nuanced?
   - Do they have depth (like tragic heroes, complex motivations)?
   - Are they more than just plot functions?

4. Motivation & Drive:
   - Do characters have clear wants, fears, and stakes?
   - Are their motivations driving the story forward?
