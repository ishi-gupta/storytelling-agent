Plot Sophistication Judge

Evaluates plot structure, context management, and cliché usage.

1. Plot Sophistication:
   - Is the plot structure interesting and well-constructed?
   - Are there unexpected but logical developments?
   - Is the mystery/structure flat or predictable?

2. Context Management:
   - Are interesting details from earlier used in interesting ways later?
   - Are setups paid off effectively (Chekov's guns)?
   - Is there thematic coherence throughout?

3. Clichés & Templates:
   - How does the writing use clichés? Does it use them in an interesting way?
   - Could benefit from story templates and instructions to neatly deviate from them
   - Are there fresh takes on familiar tropes?
   - Is the structure too formulaic or does it have unique elements?
